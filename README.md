# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## Introduction
This Python script generates Fibonacci numbers based on user input. It prompts the user to specify the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate and then outputs the sequence.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the desired number of Fibonacci numbers to generate when prompted.
3. The script will then print the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number.

## Code Explanation
- The initial values of the Fibonacci sequence are defined as `x = 0` and `y = 1`.
- The script prompts the user to input the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
- It initializes an empty list to store the Fibonacci numbers.
- Using a loop, it generates the Fibonacci sequence and appends each number to the list.
- Finally, it prints the generated Fibonacci sequence.
